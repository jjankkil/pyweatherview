2026-01-29 - refactor/separation-of-concerns

- Refactored codebase to improve separation of concerns:
  - Added `controller` package with `AppController` and `WeatherService`.
  - Moved UI helpers to `view/ui_helpers.py` and added `view/background_worker.py` for background network calls.
  - Extracted physics calculations to `model/physics.py` and model helpers to `model/helpers.py`.
  - Hardened `RequestRunner` in `utils/web_utils.py` for robust HTTP and JSON error handling.
  - Added shims in `utils` to preserve backward compatibility.

- Tests and CI:
  - Added extensive pytest suite under `tests/` covering controller, service, utils, model, and view helpers.
  - Added `requirements.txt`, `.coveragerc`, and GitHub Actions CI workflow to run tests and coverage.
  - Initial coverage threshold set to 50% (can be raised as more UI code is covered).

- Misc:
  - Added `scripts/smoke_test.py` and `scripts/create_branch_and_commit.ps1`.
  - Created per-commit patch metadata under `patches/`.

Notes:
- All changes are on branch `refactor/separation-of-concerns`.
- Please run `python -m pytest` to run the test suite locally.
